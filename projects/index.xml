      <description>Summary In our globalized world there is increased economic migration to high income countries like Canada. Economic migrants face the problem of finding relevant information without wasting precious time. The concept of a crowdsourced AI platform was proposed as a solution - by providing personalized information based on the user’s unique profile. A multi-sided business model was designed with big picture numbers showing profitability in 3 years.
Challenge To explore and identity opportunities for innovation along the Migrant worker&amp;rsquo;s immigration journey, to ideate and evaluate solutions and to create a strategy for the implementation of the tested strategy.</description>

      <description>Summary CUPRA is an offshoot of the spanish automobile manufacturer SEAT. As a relatively new automobile brand, a major objective is to find ways to stand out in the market by finding a niche for themselves. Targeting sport driving aficionados means creating experiences that they are able to connect with. In this project, we created a concept of sports driving using digital and connectivity technology called Cupra Vision.
Challenge What does the vision of an individualised CUPRA sports driving experience look like?</description>

      <description>Challenge Design a way to turn a passive commute into an active interaction? How do we provide the walking commuter with opportunities for exploration and adventure?
My Role Researcher / Ideation / Interaction Design
Research and Insights The team I was working with carried out in-depth interviews with walking commuters in the Gracia area of Barcelona. The following are some insights that we uncovered.
 Commuters rarely change their route to work or school for years Only 1 in 5 people have consciously explored their neighbourhoods A walking commuter’s mood changes depending on whether she is going to or coming back from work  Solution We generated some ideas but finally landed on the concept for an app that shows the user events, discounts, new spots, photospots and street art in their neighbourhood.</description>
