      <description>Summary CUPRA is an offshoot of the spanish automobile manufacturer SEAT. As a relatively new automobile brand, a major objective is to find ways to stand out in the market by finding a niche for themselves.

In this project, we created a concept of sports driving using digital and connectivity technology called Cupra Vision.
