Below is the list of books that I read in the year 2019 organized into fiction and non-fiction which some highlights on the books that really stood out to me.</description>

As a relatively new automobile brand, a major objective is to find ways to stand out in the market by finding a niche for themselves. Targeting sport driving aficionados means creating experiences that they are able to connect with. In this project, we created a concept of sports driving using digital and connectivity technology called Cupra Vision.
Challenge What does the vision of an individualised CUPRA sports driving experience look like?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a business designer with a background in visual communication, UX design and technology education. I help global organisations capture, create and communicate with clarity using design thinking.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently spending my days helping fortune 1000 companies design better products at DMI. In my evenings, I’m finding ways to help Nigerian self-taught designers level up their design skills using initiatives like LogoMarch. On weekends, I read hard science fiction and build tech things using no-code tools.</description>
