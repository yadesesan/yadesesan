      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a business designer with a background in visual communication, UX design and technology education. I help global organisations capture, create and communicate with clarity using design thinking.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently spending my days helping fortune 1000 companies design better products at DMI. In my evenings, Iâ€™m finding ways to help Nigerian self-taught designers level up their design skills using initiatives like LogoMarch. On weekends, I read hard science fiction and build tech things using no-code tools.</description>
